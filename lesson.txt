Lesson Topic: Understanding Fractions
SEL Focus: Self-Awareness

Lesson Objectives:
By the end of this lesson, students will be able to identify and understand basic fractions, and draw them accurately. They will also develop self-awareness by recognizing their own strengths and areas for improvement in the learning process.

Materials:
Chart paper, markers, fraction circles, paper, pencils, exit slips

Lesson Procedure:

1. Hook: Begin the lesson by showing students a whole pizza and asking how they would share it with a friend. Record their responses on the chart paper. 

2. Direct Instruction: Introduce the concept of fractions using the pizza example, explaining that fractions are a way to show parts of a whole. Show them how a pizza can be divided into halves, thirds, or quarters, and how these divisions represent fractions. Use fraction circles to demonstrate different fractions.

3. Game/Practice: Divide students into pairs and give each pair a set of fraction circles. Ask them to show different fractions with their circles. For example, they might show 1/2, 1/4, or 3/4. Circulate and provide help as needed.

4. Reflection Question: Ask students to reflect on their understanding of fractions. They might consider questions such as, "Which fractions are easiest for you to understand? Which are hardest? Why?" Encourage them to recognize where they're doing well and where they might need to improve, fostering self-awareness.

5. Exit Slip: As a closing activity, give each student an exit slip with a picture of a whole divided into parts. Ask them to color in the correct portion of the whole to represent a given fraction. Also, include a question about their understanding of the lesson, and what they found difficult or easy.

Assessment: 
Assess students based on their participation in the game and their exit slips. Make sure to note any areas where students seem to be struggling for future instruction.

Homework:
Assign students to draw and color fractions of different objects at home and bring them to class the next day. This will reinforce their understanding of fractions. 

SEL Connection:
Through the reflection question, students will gain more self-awareness as they identify their strengths and weaknesses in understanding fractions. This helps foster a growth mindset by recognizing areas for improvement.
