Title: Understanding Decimal Points with a Focus on Self-Management

Grade Level: 4th Grade

Subject: Math

SEL Focus: Self-Management

Louisiana Standards: 
- MA.4.NSO.1.4: Demonstrate an understanding of decimal notation for fractions, and compare decimal fractions.
- MA.4.NSO.1.5: Use decimal notation for fractions with denominators 10 or 100.
- SEL.4.SM.1: Set a respectful tone for interactions with others.
- SEL.4.SM.2: Identify and apply the steps for setting and achieving short-term goals.

Objectives:
- Students will understand the concept of decimal points and how they connect to fractions.
- Students will be able to compare different decimal fractions.
- Students will learn how to manage their learning process, set goals, and evaluate their progress towards these goals.

Materials:
- Decimal cards
- Whiteboard and markers
- Worksheets for guided practice
- Exit slips

Hook:
Start the lesson by splitting the class into small groups and distributing decimal cards to each group. Ask them to arrange the decimals from smallest to largest. This hands-on activity will stimulate their interest and curiosity about decimals. 

Direct Instruction:
- Explain the concept of decimal points, how they represent parts of a whole, and how they connect to fractions.
- Demonstrate how to read and write decimals.
- Show examples of comparing decimals and explain how the value of a decimal changes depending on its position.
- Discuss the SEL focus: self-management. Explain that it involves setting personal goals, tracking progress, and adjusting actions if necessary to achieve those goals. Make the link to learning about decimals: setting a goal to understand and use decimals, practicing, and checking their understanding.

Activity:
Play a game of "Decimal War". Similar to the card game "War", students compare their decimal cards and the highest value wins. This game will help students practice comparing decimals while also encouraging them to manage their game strategy.

Guided Practice:
Provide worksheets that include problems on reading, writing, and comparing decimals. Walk around the classroom to monitor progress, provide guidance, and answer any questions. Encourage students to check their work and assess their understanding.

Reflection Questions:
- How did you feel when you were trying to understand decimals? What strategies did you use to help?
- What goal did you set for yourself today in understanding decimals? How close are you to reaching it?
- How did you manage your time and focus during the activities and practice?
- How can you apply self-management in other areas of your studies and life?

Exit Slip:
Ask students to complete an exit slip before leaving. They should write one thing they learned about decimals, one question they still have, and rate their understanding on a scale of 1-5. This will provide you with important feedback for planning future lessons and identifying any students who may need additional support.

Remember, learning about decimals and self-management skills are both important for students' academic and personal growth. Through this lesson, students will not only gain math knowledge but also learn valuable skills that will benefit them in all areas of life.
