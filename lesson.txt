Title: The American Revolution and Responsible Decision-Making

Lesson Duration: 60 minutes

Hook: Begin the lesson by showing a short, engaging animated video about the American Revolution. This should be appropriate for 2nd graders, introducing the main characters, events, and reasons behind the Revolution.

Learning Objectives:
1. Students will be able to understand the basic events and people involved in the American Revolution.
2. Students will identify the causes and effects of the American Revolution.
3. Students will understand the concept of decision-making and its consequences.
4. Students will demonstrate responsible decision-making skills in a real-life context.

Direct Instruction:
1. Using a PowerPoint presentation, introduce the key players and events in the American Revolution (George Washington, the Boston Tea Party, the Declaration of Independence, etc.)
2. Discuss the causes and outcomes of the Revolution, emphasizing how decisions made by both the British and the colonists led to the war and its eventual outcome.
3. Introduce the concept of responsible decision-making. Discuss why it's important and how it can affect the outcome of situations.

Engaging Activity:
Conduct a role-playing game where students are assigned roles from the American Revolution (British, colonists, King George III, George Washington, etc.) They must make decisions based on their character's perspective. Create scenarios where they have to make decisions, such as "Should we fight against the British or not?" or "Should we impose taxes on the colonists?"

Guided Practice:
As the role-play progresses, pause at critical moments to discuss their decisions as a class. Ask students, "Why did you make that decision?" "What were the possible consequences?" "Was it a responsible decision?"

Reflection Questions:
1. What were some of the decisions made during the American Revolution? 
2. How did these decisions affect the outcome of the Revolution?
3. How can we apply what we learned about decision-making in the American Revolution to our own lives?
4. Can you give an example of a responsible decision you made recently? How did it affect you and others around you?

Exit Slip: 
On a piece of paper, have each student write one thing they learned about the American Revolution and one thing they learned about responsible decision-making. They should also write one way they plan to make responsible decisions in their own life based on what they learned in today's lesson.

Materials Needed: 
1. Computer with projector for the video and PowerPoint presentation
2. Role-playing game scenarios and character cards
3. Pieces of paper for exit slips

This lesson plan is designed to be hands-on and engaging to help students understand the complex topic of the American Revolution and the importance of responsible decision-making. The focus on SEL will help students connect historical events to their own lives, enhancing their understanding and empathy.
