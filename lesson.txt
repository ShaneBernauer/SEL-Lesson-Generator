Lesson Plan: Understanding Fractions

Subject: Mathematics
Grade Level: 2nd Grade
SEL Focus: Self-Awareness
Duration: 1 hour

Learning Objectives:
1. Students will understand the basic concept of fractions.
2. Students will be able to identify fractions in practical settings.
3. Students will develop self-awareness by understanding their own progress and areas of improvement.

Hook:
Begin the lesson by showing the students a pizza and ask how many would like to have some. Cut the pizza into 8 pieces and ask them how many pieces each would get if we have to divide it equally among 4 students. This will lead to the introduction of fractions in a fun and relatable way.

Direct Instruction:
1. Explain the concept of fractions by using the pizza example. 
2. Introduce the terms 'numerator' and 'denominator' and explain their roles in fractions.
3. Use various other examples such as dividing a candy bar, a cake, or a pie into parts to solidify the concept of fractions.
4. Show examples of fractions in different forms like ½, ¼, ¾ etc. and explain what they represent.

Activity/Game:
1. Fractions Match-Up: Prepare fraction cards and picture cards that represent these fractions. Mix them up and spread them on the table. The students have to match the fraction cards with the correct picture cards. This will help them visualize fractions and understand them better.

Guided Practice:
1. Provide students with worksheets that contain pictures divided into parts. They have to write the correct fraction that represents each picture.
2. For higher difficulty, include pictures that represent improper fractions and mixed numbers.

Reflection Questions (SEL Focus: Self-Awareness):
1. What parts of today's fraction lesson did you find easy?
2. Which parts did you find difficult and why?
3. How can you improve in those areas?
4. How did you feel when you were able to match the fractions correctly in the game?

Exit Slip:
Before the students leave, give them an exit slip with a few questions that test their understanding of fractions. This could include questions like:

1. Draw a picture that represents the fraction ¾.
2. Write down the fraction that represents half.
3. Which fraction is bigger: ½ or ¼? 

This exit slip will help to assess the students' understanding of the concepts taught in the lesson and identify any areas where they might need additional practice or instruction.

Note: This lesson plan integrates the SEL focus of Self-Awareness by encouraging students to understand their strengths and weaknesses in learning fractions. Throughout the lesson, students are prompted to reflect on their learning process and identify areas where they are struggling. This fosters self-awareness and helps them to take ownership of their learning.
