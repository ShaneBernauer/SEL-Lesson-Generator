Lesson Title: "Morning Check-in: Growing Our Minds"

Objective: Students will understand the concept of growth mindset, be able to express their feelings using a mood scale, and engage in a short activity that promotes growth mindset.

Time Required: 20 minutes

Materials Needed: 
1. Mood Scale (1-5) printed on large poster board.
2. Small sticky notes or markers for each student.
3. Paper and pencils for all students.
4. Chart paper and markers for teacher.

Procedure:

1. Begin the morning by gathering the students in a circle. Explain that everyone will start the day by sharing how they're feeling using the mood scale. The scale ranges from 1 (very sad) to 5 (very happy).

2. Allow each student to place a sticky note or marker on the mood scale to represent how they're feeling.

3. After all students have placed their markers, discuss the range of feelings in the classroom. Normalize all feelings and reassure students that it's okay to have different feelings. 

4. Transition into the concept of growth mindset. Explain that a growth mindset means believing that we can improve and learn new things with effort and perseverance.

5. On the chart paper, create two columns: "Fixed Mindset" and "Growth Mindset". Ask students for examples of both mindsets, guiding them to understanding that a fixed mindset believes abilities are limited, while a growth mindset believes abilities can always improve. Write their responses in the appropriate columns.

6. For the short activity, provide each student with a piece of paper and a pencil. Ask them to draw two pictures - one showing a time they thought they couldn't do something (fixed mindset), and another showing how they overcame a challenge (growth mindset). 

7. Allow students to share their drawings if they wish. This activity will help students connect the concept of growth mindset to their own experiences.

Wrap Up:

Remind students that everyone can have both fixed and growth mindsets at times, but the goal is to try and have a growth mindset as much as possible. Encourage them to remember their drawings when they face a challenge, reminding themselves that with effort, they can improve and grow. 

Just like their feelings in the morning, their mindset can change throughout the day, and that's perfectly fine. The important part is to keep trying, keep growing, and keep learning. 

This check-in serves as a daily reminder for students about the importance of understanding their feelings and the power of having a growth mindset. It's a simple yet effective way of blending SEL with academic content in an engaging manner.
