Lesson Plan: Westward Expansion in U.S. History

Grade Level: 8th Grade
Subject: History
Topic: Westward Expansion
SEL Focus: Self-Management

**Learning Objectives**
Students will be able to:
1. Understand the reasons and impacts of westward expansion in U.S. history.
2. Demonstrate knowledge of key events, people, and places involved in westward expansion.
3. Connect the concept of westward expansion with the idea of self-management.

**Materials Needed**
1. History textbooks or digital resources on Westward Expansion
2. Large map of the United States
3. Sticky notes, markers
4. Paper and pencils for note-taking and writing

**Hook**
Begin the lesson by presenting a scenario: “Imagine you are a settler in the 1800s. You hear about the opportunities in the West and decide to pack your belongings and journey across the country. What would you pack? How would you plan your journey? What challenges might you face?” This scenario will engage the students and set the stage for the lesson.

**Direct Instruction**
1. Provide a brief overview of westward expansion in the U.S., discussing the reasons why settlers moved westward (e.g., Manifest Destiny, Gold Rush, Homestead Act), the challenges they faced, and the impact on Native American tribes.
2. Show a map of the U.S. and discuss the routes settlers took, pointing out significant landmarks or events along the way.

**Engaging Activity/Game: “Journey West”**
1. Divide the class into small groups representing different families of settlers. Each group will have a map of the U.S. and will need to plan their route westward, deciding which landmarks to visit, how much food and supplies to bring, and how to handle potential challenges (e.g., harsh weather, disease, conflict with Native Americans).
2. As they make their plans, discuss the concept of self-management—making decisions, setting goals, managing stress, and staying motivated. Highlight how these skills would have been essential for settlers during westward expansion.

**Guided Practice**
Assign each group to research a key event, person, or place related to westward expansion (e.g., the Oregon Trail, Lewis and Clark, the Gold Rush). They will then present their findings to the class, discussing how settlers might have used self-management skills during this event or situation.

**Reflection Questions**
1. How did settlers need to use self-management skills during westward expansion?
2. How might the challenges of westward expansion have impacted settlers’ ability to manage themselves?
3. How can we apply the concept of self-management to our own lives?

**Exit Slip**
Before they leave, ask each student to write down one thing they learned about westward expansion and one way they can improve their own self-management skills based on today’s lesson.

**Assessment**
Assess students' understanding through their participation in the "Journey West" activity, their group presentations, and their responses to the reflection questions and exit slip.
