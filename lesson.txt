SEL Focus: Social Awareness

Duration: 2 hours 

Materials:

Lesson Objectives:
- Students will be able to identify differences and similarities between past and present communities.
- Students will be able to understand the concept of change over time.
- Students will develop social awareness by considering how changes in communities affect individuals and groups.

Hook:
Begin the lesson with a short, engaging video that shows a brief history of communities from the past and present. After the video, ask students to share what they noticed about the communities in the video.

Direct Instruction:
1. Explain the concept of communities and how they have evolved over time, focusing on aspects such as technology, buildings, transportation, and social norms.

2. Use a PowerPoint presentation to show pictures of different communities from different time periods. Discuss the visible changes and the reasons behind these changes.

3. Discuss the role of individuals in shaping communities and how changes in communities can affect individuals and groups.

Activity:
1. Divide students into small groups and assign each group a specific time period (e.g., 1800s, 1900s, 2000s).

2. Provide each group with chart paper and markers. Ask them to draw a community from their assigned time period, incorporating elements discussed during the lesson.

3. Once finished, have each group present their community to the class, explaining the features and why they included them.

Guided Practice:
Provide students with worksheets that contain pictures of different communities. Ask them to identify the time period of the community, list the features that helped them decide, and write about how the community might have changed over time.

Reflection Questions:
1. How do you think the changes in communities affect the people living there?
2. How do you think you can contribute to your community?
3. What changes would you like to see in our community?

These questions aim to help students develop social awareness, understanding how changes in communities can affect individuals and groups, and recognizing their role in shaping their communities.

Exit Slip:
For the exit slip, ask students to write down one thing they learned about communities and one way they think they can contribute to their own community. They should also write down any questions they have about the topic.

This lesson plan is designed to be engaging and interactive, allowing students to explore the concept of communities in a hands-on way. It also integrates social-emotional learning by promoting social awareness and encouraging students to think about their role in their communities.
