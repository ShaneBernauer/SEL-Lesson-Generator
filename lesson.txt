SEL Focus: Responsible Decision-Making

Louisiana State Standards: 
- RL.2.2: Recount stories, including fables and folktales from diverse cultures, and determine their central message, lesson, or moral.
- SL.2.1: Participate in collaborative conversations with diverse partners about grade 2 topics and texts with peers and adults in small and larger groups.

Lesson Procedure:

Hook (5 minutes): 
Begin the lesson by asking students, "Have you ever had to make a big decision? How did it affect you and others?" Allow students to share their experiences. This will serve as an introduction to the SEL focus on responsible decision-making.

Direct Instruction (15 minutes): 
Introduce the concept of the main idea. Explain that the main idea is the most important point or message that the author wants us to understand from the story or text. Use a simple, familiar story to demonstrate this concept. Encourage students to use highlighters to identify the main idea and supporting details in the story.

For ASD students, provide visual supports like a graphic organizer to help them understand the concept of main idea and supporting details. Use headphones for children with sensory needs to minimize distractions.

Activity (20 minutes): 
Divide the students into small groups and give each group a short storybook about a historical event. Ask them to read the story and identify the main idea and supporting details. Encourage them to discuss how the characters in the story made decisions and the consequences of those decisions.

For ASD students, provide social stories that include pictures and simple language. Allow them to work with a peer or a teacher's aide for assistance.

Guided Practice (10 minutes): 
Ask each group to present their findings. Guide them in discussing the main idea, supporting details, and the responsible decisions made by the characters in their assigned story.

Reflection (5 minutes): 
Ask reflection questions such as:
1. How does understanding the main idea help us understand the story better?
2. How did the characters in your story make responsible decisions? 
3. How can we apply responsible decision-making in our lives?

These questions will help students connect the lesson to the SEL focus.

Exit Slip (5 minutes): 
Hand out the "Main Idea" worksheets for students to complete individually. This will help assess their understanding of the main idea and its supporting details. Also, include a question about the importance of responsible decision-making in the worksheet.

Accommodations and Modifications for ASD students: 
1. Provide clear, step-by-step instructions with visual cues.
2. Allow extra time for ASD students to complete tasks and assignments.
3. Use social stories and visual aids to illustrate complex concepts.
4. Minimize distractions by providing a quiet and structured learning environment.
5. Collaborate with special education teachers and aides to provide individualized support.

By the end of this lesson, students will have a deeper understanding of the concept of main idea in historical events and its connection to responsible decision-making. They will also learn to apply these skills in their daily lives.
