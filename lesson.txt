Lesson Title: "Math Mates: Understanding Fractions and Social Awareness"

Objective: To enhance 4th-grade students' general math skills by practicing fractions while cultivating Social and Emotional Learning (SEL) skills, particularly Social Awareness.

Materials: Cardstock papers with fractions, Blank papers, Pencils, Colors

Procedures:

1. Gather students in a circle for the lesson introduction. Explain the day's objective of understanding fractions while learning to be more socially aware.

2. Provide an explanation of fractions and give examples. Ensure to gauge understanding and answer arising questions.

3. Now, break students into groups of four. Each group receives a set of cardstock papers with different fractions.

4. Students within each group will be asked to work together to arrange their fractions, smallest to largest. Emphasize that it's not a competition but a learning process, they need to be patient and listen to each other's ideas.

5. During the course of the activity, walk around to each group. Observe and guide as needed but allow students to work independently.

6. Once complete, each group presents their arranged fractions, explaining how they arrived at their results. This fosters their abilities to articulate their thoughts clearly, a useful social skill.

7. Facilitate a discussion on how the process went. Ask students to reflect on the listening, cooperation, understanding, and perspective taking skills they utilized during the activity.

8. To wrap up the lesson, have students individually draw a picture about how they used and observed social awareness during the group activities. They can share their drawings and reflections if they wish.

Assessment: Assess the students based on both their understanding of the math content (arranging fractions correctly) and their ability to demonstrate social awareness skills in collaborating with their peers.

SEL Skills Highlighted: This lesson helps students understand and appreciate others' perspectives, reinforcing the importance of working as a team, respectful communication, and social awareness in both academic and social settings. 

Homework: For homework, students can practice their fractions through worksheets and reflect on how they can apply their social awareness skills in other areas of their lives â€“ both in and out of school. 

Hey, presto! You have a math lesson integrated with social awareness.
