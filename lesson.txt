Lesson Title: The American Revolution

Subject: History

Duration: 60 minutes

Grade Level: 1st Grade

SEL Focus: Social Awareness (Understanding perspectives and historical experiences)

Lesson Objectives:
1. Students will be able to identify the main events and key figures of the American Revolution.
2. Students will understand the causes and effects of the American Revolution.
3. Students will develop social awareness by understanding different perspectives during the American Revolution.

Materials Required:
1. Story of the American Revolution (age-appropriate book or video)
2. Paper and coloring materials
3. Role cards for activity
4. Exit slips

Lesson Procedure:

1. Hook (5 minutes): Begin the lesson by telling students that they are going to be time travelers today. They are going back to a time when America was fighting for its freedom. Show them a picture of George Washington and ask if anyone knows who he is.

2. Direct Instruction (20 minutes): Read an age-appropriate story about the American Revolution or show a short, animated video detailing the events. Emphasize the key figures such as George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and King George III, and the major events like the Boston Tea Party and the signing of the Declaration of Independence.

3. Activity (15 minutes): "The Perspective Game". Divide the students into three groups: Patriots, Loyalists, and the British. Hand out role cards with brief descriptions of each group's perspective during the American Revolution. Each group will discuss and draw a picture that represents their group's point of view.

4. Guided Practice (10 minutes): Have each group present their drawing and explain their group's perspective. Guide the students to understand the different perspectives during the American Revolution and how it led to conflict and finally, resolution.

5. Reflection Questions (5 minutes): Ask questions that connect to the SEL focus. For instance, "How do you think the Patriots felt when they decided to fight for their freedom? How about the Loyalists who wanted to stay loyal to the King? How do you think the British felt? Why is it important to understand different people's feelings and perspectives?"

6. Exit Slip (5 minutes): Hand out exit slips and ask students to write one thing they learned about the American Revolution and one thing they learned about understanding different perspectives. 

Assessment: Assess students' understanding through their group presentations, answers to reflection questions, and exit slips.

Homework: Encourage students to talk to their parents or caregivers about a time they had a different perspective from someone else and how they resolved it. 

This lesson plan not only educates students about the American Revolution but also fosters social awareness by helping them understand different perspectives and empathize with others' feelings and experiences.
