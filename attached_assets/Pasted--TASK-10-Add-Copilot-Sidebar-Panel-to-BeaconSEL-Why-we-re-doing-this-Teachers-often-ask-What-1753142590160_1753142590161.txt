✅ TASK 10: Add Copilot Sidebar Panel to BeaconSEL
🔧 Why we're doing this:
Teachers often ask: “What SEL skill fits here?”

This turns BeaconSEL into more than a generator—it becomes a thinking partner

It's exactly what AI in EdTech should feel like: kind + helpful

🪜 Step-by-Step Replit Instructions
✅ STEP 1: Add the Copilot HTML Panel
👨‍💻 File: templates/layout.html
📍 Add this block just before </body> tag at the bottom:

html
Copy
Edit
<!-- Copilot Panel -->
<div id="copilotPanel" class="position-fixed end-0 top-0 bg-white border-start shadow p-3" style="width: 300px; height: 100vh; display: none; z-index: 1040;">
  <h5>🧠 BeaconSEL Copilot</h5>
  <p class="text-muted">Not sure where to start?</p>

  <strong>💡 SEL Tips:</strong>
  <ul style="padding-left: 1rem;">
    <li>Math + Frustration → Try <b>Self-Regulation</b></li>
    <li>Group Work → <b>Relationship Skills</b></li>
    <li>ELA Character Study → <b>Empathy</b></li>
    <li>Test Prep or Sub Days → <b>Decision-Making</b></li>
  </ul>

  <strong>🗣️ Sample Teacher Talk:</strong>
  <blockquote style="font-size: 0.9rem;">
    "I notice some of us feel frustrated—let's pause and take a breath together."
  </blockquote>

  <strong>📋 Prompt Idea:</strong>
  <p><code>“Create a 5-minute calm-down game linked to math fluency drills.”</code></p>

  <button onclick="toggleCopilot()" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-danger mt-3">Close</button>
</div>

<!-- Copilot Toggle Button -->
<button onclick="toggleCopilot()" class="btn btn-warning position-fixed bottom-0 end-0 m-4 shadow">🧠 Copilot</button>

<script>
function toggleCopilot() {
  const panel = document.getElementById("copilotPanel");
  panel.style.display = panel.style.display === "none" ? "block" : "none";
}
</script>
✅ STEP 2: Style It Just a Bit More
Already using Bootstrap? Great. If you want more polish, you could customize this later with:

Scroll support

Dynamic content (from OpenAI, even)

Context awareness (suggest based on form inputs)

✅ OPTIONAL: Add More Content Later
Want to pull live Copilot ideas based on subject/SEL combo? You could use a GPT call like:

python
Copy
Edit
copilot_prompt = f"Suggest 3 SEL skills that pair well with a {grade} grade {subject} lesson on {topic}. Also suggest 1 sample student reflection and 1 sentence the teacher might say to guide discussion."
But for now, the static panel makes BeaconSEL feel smarter, supportive, and ready for anything.

🎉 You Now Have:
A floating “🧠 Copilot” button teachers can summon any time

SEL pairing tips, sample teacher talk, and prompt examples

A core UX element that makes the product feel emotionally intelligent—not robotic
